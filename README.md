# AncFil
Manual for AncFil
Version 1.0
1.	Introduction
The main function of the AncFil is to rescue the highly homologous-contaminated ancient samples based on the post-mortem damage patterns. There are several key parameters that will influence the filtering accuracy including the length of ancient DNA, the depurination characteristic and the deaminated C-to-T and G-to-A changes at ends of ancient DNA fragments. We strongly recommended to screen reads with at least one C-to-T or G-to-A changes within the first or last 15 bp at 3’ or 5’ ends for this script. 
 
2.	Requirements
1.	Python >=3.7.7
2.	Python package pyfaidx
3.	Parameters
Parameters	Parameter Type	Description
-i/--input	string	Sam file generated by BWA 
-o/--output	string	The output sam file after filtering.
-r/--reference	string	Reference genome with index built ( .fai format file).
-m/--mode	string	Filtering mode based on depurination or deamination
(-m: depurination/deamination)
-DeamNum	num	Screening reads with at least “-DeamNum” C-to-T or G-to-A changes at ends of DNA fragments
-DetectRange	num	Screening reads with C-to-T or G-to-A changes within the first or last “-DetectRange” base pair
-DoubleOrSingle	string	Screening reads with C-to-T or G-to-A changes at 3’ and/or 5’ ends. (-DoubleOrSingle: and/or)
-t	num	Number of threads [5]
-h	string	Show the help message

4.	Example:

a.	Screening based on deamination patterns:
python AncFil.py -i path/test.sam -o path/output.sam -r reference_path/ref.fa -m deamination -DeamNum 1 -DetectRange 15 -DoubleOrSingle or

b.	Screening based on depurination patterns:
python AncFil.py -i path/test.sam -o path/output.sam -r reference_path/ref.fa -m depurination



(1)	The format of test.sam/output.sam: This is a normal Sam file with a format as following:

(2)	ref.fa: This is a reference genome file with the normal Fasta format:

5.	Output files:
The AncFil will finally generate 1 output file:
1.	Output.sam: this is a sam file without headers:
